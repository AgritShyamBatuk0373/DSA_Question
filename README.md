## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to practicing and improving my skills in data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. It includes a variety of problems from different categories, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

You can clone this repository using the following command:

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the directory containing the problem you want to run.
2. Compile the C file using a C compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc array_problem1.c -o array_problem1

3.  Run the compiled executable:
    ./array_problem1


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional problems to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
